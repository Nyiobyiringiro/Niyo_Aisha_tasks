<h1>HAMK's IT Services</h1>
<p>When you join as a student, you will receive a personal user ID, with which you can log in to HAMK computers and many different systems.
 We are in charge of the IT infrastructure and all of its services, including the functionality of equipment and systems, and we provide training in their use, as well as problem-solving advice.

Remember to follow our Yammer-group where we inform you about updates, error situations and other topics concerning HAMKâ€™s computers, programs and learning systems.</p>
